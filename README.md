**TLDR**; Phoenix allows users to keep track of their current job applications, networking progress and job search statistics all in one with summary emails every week and daily job progress statistics. Features include:
- Allowing job seekers to give mentors, parents, accountability buddies - called "believers" - access to their progress by choosing which pages they have access to
- Editable kanban board of the week's tasks by both the user and selected "believers"
- Weekly summary emails to the job seeker and selected "believers"
- Notifications when a job is created, a job status is updated or a job posting is closed
- Leaderboards of the most involved job seekers based on application and networking ratios
- Increasingly better job suggestions
- Import and export of the data through CSV files
- And more in development...
